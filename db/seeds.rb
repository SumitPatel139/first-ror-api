# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  # Article.create([{ title: "Star Wars", author: "Sumit" },{title: "Helen Keller", author: "xyz"}])
